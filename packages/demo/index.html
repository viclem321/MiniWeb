INDEX.HTML - The file to deliver to clients

This is the static HTML page that serves as the container for the leaf-js demo.

It's intentionally minimal because in a single-page application (SPA),
everything is handled client-side by JavaScript. The server only needs to deliver
this HTML file (just don't forget to include the compiled JS bundle via a <script> tag).

This page does just a few things:
- Loads custom fonts from Google Fonts
- Loads the JavaScript bundle (`/dist/bundle.mjs`) generated by Rollup
- Provides a <div id="root"> where the leaf-js app will be mounted
